some details
----------

1. You can use "export name=value" to change environment variables, 
	to show them, use "echo name".
	Especially, you can use "export $PE=style" to change the prompt style.
	And the style supports 3 special characters:
		\u		current user
		\w		current working directory
		\h		host name of the computer
	For example, when setting:
		$ export $PE=\u@\h:\w>
	you will get a prompt like this:
		can@cans-macbook.local:/Users/can/github/myShell>

2. You can add a "&" at the end of a command line,
	to make it run in the background. For example,
		$ ./test/while1 &
	But "&" can not appear in the middle of a command line, like:
		$ ls & -a -l
	You should change this to:
		$ ls -a -l &

3. You can use "<" or ">" to make input or output redirections,
	for example,
		$ ./test/echo < echo.c > echoout.txt
	"<" and ">" can only appear once in a command
